This program calculates a payment schedule for a loan based on a purchase price. The user inputs the purchase price, and the program calculates the monthly payments, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each month until the loan is paid off. It assumes a 10% down payment and a 12% annual interest rate. The monthly payment is 5% of the purchase price minus the down payment.
